You need two devices:

2. Any other device, where you can run Albion Online (any platform)

### How to run

Next guide is for pair of Windows PC (or VM with Windows) and another PC.

#### Install some required components (only first time) on 1st PC (or VM)

### 1st PC (or VM) for radar

1. Install npcap: https://npcap.com/dist/npcap-1.80.exe
2. Install .NET Framework 4.8 Runtime: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net48
3. Download the latest build from Releases and extract it to any directory
4. Download items images from https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Egji6ceOt3eBh6yE9-zxB4OPtoWMYSby/view?usp=sharing and
   extract directory ITEMS (it contains only images) to root directory of the radar.
   Replace all previous files if asked.
5. Download ao-bin-dumps
   from [https://github.com/ao-data/ao-bin-dumps](https://github.com/ao-data/ao-bin-dumps/archive/refs/heads/master.zip)
   and content of directory ao-bin-dumps-master into ao-bin-dumps directory in root directory of the radar.
   Replace all previous files if asked.
6. Download the latest version of traffic decryption tool Cryptonite from our Discord server (channel `#cryptonite`) and
   extract all files to any directory.
7. Find your local IP address ([Video Tutorial](https://youtu.be/goTdaCFog3U))
8. You should see the following files:
    - `Cryptonite.CLI.exe` - main executable, don't run it directly because it need options, see eu.bat for example.
    - `eu.bat` - for Europe
    - `am.bat` - for America
    - `as.bat` - for Asia
      :warning: Only one can be used at a time.
9. Choose file for your server and open it in Notepad, replace `my_local_ip` with your local IP address and save the
   file.

### 2nd PC for Albion Online client

We just redirect the game client traffic to the 1st PC.
Your PCs should be in the same network.

#### Windows

1. Run Notepad as Administrator.
2. Open the file `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts`.
3. Add the following lines at the end of the file (replace `my_local_ip` with your local IP address of the 1st PC):
   ```
   my_local_ip live03-loginserver.ams.albion.zone # for Europe
   my_local_ip live02-loginserver.sg.albion.zone # for Asia
   my_local_ip loginserver.live.albion.zone # for America (use live01-win-01.dc02.albion.zone if it doesn't work)
   ```
4. Save the file.

#### Linux

Linux users should add the lines to `/etc/hosts` file (ex: use terminal and `sudo nano /etc/hosts`).

#### macOS

Mac users should add the lines to `/private/etc/hosts` file (ex: use terminal and `sudo nano /private/etc/hosts`).

📌 If you don't want to use Cryptonite anymore, just remove the lines from the `hosts` file (or comment them
typing `#` at the beginning of the line).

That's all, next time you can just run Cryptonite and radar on the 1st PC and Albion Online on the 2nd PC.

#### Run

1. `1st PC:` Run Cryptonite (use .bat depending on your game server)
2. `1st PC:` Run radar X975.exe
3. `2nd PC:` Run Albion Online

### How to build
